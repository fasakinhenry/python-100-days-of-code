# Python 100 days of code

Learn with Angela Yu and actually build projects? Yes. I have to learn python and build along within 100 days.

> Made with 💖 and hardwork by [Fasakin Henry](https://x.com/henqsoft) | [see all projects](#projects)

## How to Use

To start the Python 100 Days of Code project:

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fasakinhenry/python-100-days-of-code.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd python-100-days-of-code/category/day_folder
    ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open and review the Python file.

5. Modify and run the code:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
6. Enjoy coding!

Don’t forget to commit and push your changes to track your progress.

## Folder structure

Here is the folder structure of the repository:

```

├─ 00-beginner
│  ├─ day-01
│  │  ├─ README.md
│  │  ├─ concepts
│  │  │  ├─ 00_hello-world.py
│  │  │  └─ ...

### Summary of file structure

The file structure of the repository is organized as follows:

- The root directory contains the main README.md file.
- Inside the root directory, there is a folder named "00-beginner" which contains the beginner level projects, other level directories are present too(intermediate, advanced etc)
- Each day of the 100-day coding challenge is represented by a subfolder inside the level directories(folders).
- Inside each day's subfolder, there is a README.md file that provides information about the day's project.
- Additionally, each day's subfolder contains a "concepts" folder which includes Python code files demonstrating various concepts related to that day's project.
- Finally, each day's subfolder also contains a "main.py" file which is the main Python file for that day's project.

This folder structure allows for easy navigation and organization of the projects based on their difficulty level and day of the challenge.
