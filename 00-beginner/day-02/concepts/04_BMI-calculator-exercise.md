# BMI Calculator

## Instructions

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. For example, if a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

> BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2

**Warning:** You should convert the result to a whole number.

## Example Input

```python
weight = 80
height = 1.75
```

## Example Output

When you run the program, this is what should happen:

## Hint

- Check the data type of the inputs.
- Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
- Remember PEMDAS.
- Remember to convert your result to a whole number (int).
