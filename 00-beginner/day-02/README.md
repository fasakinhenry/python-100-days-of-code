# Day 2 - Understanding Data types and How to Manipulate Strings

Today, we covered the following topics:

1. **Data Types**:
   - Integers
   - Floats
   - Strings
   - Booleans

2. **Numbers and Operations**:
   - Basic arithmetic operations
   - Order of operations (PEMDAS)

3. **Type Conversion**:
   - Converting between different data types

4. **f-Strings**:
   - Using f-strings for string interpolation

We also completed several exercises to practice these concepts.
