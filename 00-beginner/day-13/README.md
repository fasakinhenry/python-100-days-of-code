# Day 13 - Debugging, How to Find and Fix Errors in your code

In day 13, we learned about debugging, how to find and fix errors in your code.

## Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code. It is an essential skill for any programmer, as bugs are an inevitable part of the development process. There are several tools and techniques you can use to debug your code effectively:

- **Print Statements**: One of the simplest ways to debug your code is by using print statements to display the values of variables at different points in your program. This can help you identify where the problem is occurring and what the values of the variables are at that point.
- **Debugger**: Most modern integrated development environments (IDEs) come with a built-in debugger that allows you to step through your code line by line, inspecting the values of variables and identifying the source of errors.
- **Logging**: Logging is another useful technique for debugging your code. You can use logging libraries to log messages at different levels of severity, which can help you track the flow of your program and identify issues.
- **Unit Testing**: Writing unit tests for your code can help you identify bugs early in the development process and ensure that your code behaves as expected.
- **Code Review**: Having another programmer review your code can help you identify errors and potential issues that you may have missed.
- **Stack Overflow**: If you encounter an error that you can't solve on your own, websites like Stack Overflow can be a valuable resource for finding solutions to common programming problems.
- **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Sometimes, simply explaining your code to someone else (or even a rubber duck) can help you identify the source of errors and come up with a solution.
- **Google**: When in doubt, Google is your friend. Many programming problems have been encountered and solved by others, so a quick search can often lead you to a solution.
