# Coffee Machine Project

You are required to create a Coffee Machine Project that involves interacting with already created OOP versions of functions needed for the sub-tasks like:

- Managing items and seeing items on the menu
- Coffee Maker functions to deduct order ingredients from the resources
- Coffee Maker Functions to check report and to see if resources needed for a particular drink order are sufficient
- Money machine functions to check report in terms of profit and to ensure processing coins for payment
- Menu Item class which manages the properties of each item on the menu using attributes like name(str), cost(float) and ingredients(dictionary).

You can check the resources folder for the requirements of the project and the documentation folder for the classes implementation.
