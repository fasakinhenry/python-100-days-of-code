# Day 14 - Higher Lower Game Project

Welcome to Day 14 of the 100 days of code challenge. Today, we will be building a Higher Lower Game Project. This project is a simple number guessing game where the player has to guess whether the next number is higher or lower than the current number.

The Higher Lower Game Project will test your understanding of loops, conditionals, and functions. You will also get to practice using random numbers and user input in Python.

## What is the Higher Lower Game Project?

The Higher Lower Game according to [higherlowergame.com](https://www.higherlowergame.com/) is a simple game where you have to guess the personality of a celebrity based on the number of searches they get on Google. The game presents two celebrities, and you have to guess which one is more popular based on the number of searches they get.

The game continues until you make an incorrect guess, and your score is the number of correct guesses you make in a row. The goal is to get the highest score possible.
