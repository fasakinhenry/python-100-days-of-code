# Higher Lower Game Project

The Higher Lower Game according to [higherlowergame.com](https://www.higherlowergame.com/) is a simple game where you have to guess the personality of a celebrity based on the number of searches they get on Google. The game presents two celebrities, and you have to guess which one is more popular based on the number of searches they get.

The game continues until you make an incorrect guess, and your score is the number of correct guesses you make in a row. The goal is to get the highest score possible.
