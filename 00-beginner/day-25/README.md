# Day 25 - Working with CSV Data and the Pandas Library - Part 1

In the previous days, we learned how to work with files in Python. Today, we will learn how to work with CSV files and the Pandas library.

## Working with CSV Files

CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. It is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. Each line in a CSV file represents a row in the table, and each value in a line is separated by a comma.

Here is an example of a CSV file:

```csv
Name, Age, City
Alice, 25, New York
Bob, 30, Los Angeles
Charlie, 35, Chicago
```

To read a CSV file in Python, you can use the `csv` module. Here is an example:

```python
import csv
```

## The Pandas Library

Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures and functions to work with structured data, such as tables and time series.

To use the Pandas library, you need to install it first. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

Once you have installed the Pandas library, you can import it in your Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd
```

In the next days, we will learn how to use the Pandas library to work with CSV files and perform data analysis.

## Project: Working with CSV Data

For today's project, you will work on a game that involves American states guessing. The player will be asked to guess all the states in the United States. The game will read a CSV file containing the names of all the states and prompt the player to guess the names of the states. The player will have to keep guessing the names of the states until they have guessed all the states correctly.
