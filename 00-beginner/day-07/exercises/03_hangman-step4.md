# Hangman Step 344

The challenge involves creating some concepts needed in the Final version of the hangman game. In this challenge we want to add lives to the game and an ASCII art of an hangman to make the game more visual and fun to play with. We can implmemnt this using:

- A lives variable to check if the player has more lives in the while loop
- An array of ASCII art to store the state of the hangman for each life loss
