# Day 21 - Build the Snake Game Part 2 (Inheritance and List slicing)

In the previous lesson, we created the Snake class and the Turtle class. We also created the Snake object and moved it around the screen. In this lesson, we will add the food to the screen and make the snake grow when it eats the food.

We will doing some of the following things in this lesson:

- Create the Food class
- Detect collision with the food
- Increase the length of the snake
- Display the score on the screen
- Detect collision with the wall
- Detect collision with the tail
- End the game if the snake collides with the wall or its tail
