# Day 3 - Function Parameters and Caesar Cipher Part 01

Welcome to Day 3! Today, we will dive into Function with inputs. We will also be making a caesar cipher project that helps to encode and decode messages.

## Concepts

- [Reminder about functions](./concepts/00_function.py)
- [Function with Inputs](./concepts/01_function-with-inputs.py)
- [Positional vs. keyword Arguments](./concepts/02_function-with-more-input.py)

## Exercises

The exercises involves creating an area calculator, prime number checker and caesar cipher encryption with different levels of progress. The links to each exercise file are as follows:

- [Area calculator](./exercises/00_area-calc.md)
- [Prime number checker](./exercises/01_prime-number-checker.md)
- [Caesar Cipher - Encryption](./exercises/02_caesar-cipher-encryption.md)

## Main Project

### Caesar Cipher
