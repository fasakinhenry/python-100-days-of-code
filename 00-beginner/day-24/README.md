# Day 24 - Files, Directories and Paths

In the day 24 of the Python 100-days of code bootcamp, we will be learning about files, directories and paths in Python.

## Concepts

- [Reading from Files](./concepts/00_reading-file.py)
- [Reading files with `with` keyword](./concepts/01_reading-file-without-close.py)
- [Writing to Files](./concepts/02_writing-to-file.py)
- [Appending to Files](./concepts/03_appending-to-file.py)

## Exercises

For the exercise, we would be improving the snake game by adding the High score feature. The high score is stored in a text file and is updated when the player beats the high score. Also, when the game starts the high score is displayed on the screen by reading the high score from the text file.
