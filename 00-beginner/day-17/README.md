# Day 17 - The Quiz Project and the benefits of OOP

In Day 17, we are going to be working on the quiz project and learn all about Object Oriented Programming (OOP). These are the files for creating OOP.

## Concepts

- Creating a class
- The `__init__` method
- [Adding methods to a class](./concepts/02_methods.py)
- Creating objects from a class
- Accessing attributes and methods of an object
- The benefits of OOP

## Exercises

These are possible exercise for day 17 which can solidify your understanding of OOP:

1. Create a simple class and instantiate an object.
2. Add methods to the class and call them using the object.
3. Create multiple objects and interact with their attributes and methods.

## Project

### The Quiz Project

In this project, you will create a quiz application using OOP principles. The application will:

- Ask the user a series of questions.
- Keep track of the user's score.
- Provide feedback on the user's performance.

By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of how to use OOP to structure your code and make it more modular and reusable.
