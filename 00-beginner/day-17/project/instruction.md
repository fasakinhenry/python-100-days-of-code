# Quiz Project

The quiz project involves creating a quiz application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project is structured into multiple classes to handle different aspects of the quiz.

## Project Structure

1. **Question Class**: This class is responsible for storing the question text and the correct answer.
2. **QuizBrain Class**: This class manages the quiz logic, including keeping track of the question number, checking the user's answer, and determining if the quiz is still ongoing.
3. **Data Handling**: Questions and answers are stored in a separate file or data structure and are loaded into the application at runtime.
4. **User Interface**: The user is prompted to answer each question, and their answers are compared to the correct answers. A score is calculated based on the number of correct answers.

## Instructions

1. **Create the Question Class**: Define a class to represent a question, including its text and answer.
2. **Create the QuizBrain Class**: Define a class to manage the quiz flow, including methods to check answers and track the score.
3. **Load Questions**: Load the questions from a file or data structure into a list of Question objects.
4. **Run the Quiz**: Use the QuizBrain class to present each question to the user, check their answers, and keep track of the score.
5. **Display Results**: At the end of the quiz, display the user's final score.

Follow the principles of OOP to ensure that the code is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.
