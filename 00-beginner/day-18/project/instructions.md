# Hirst Painting Project

![Hirst Painting](image.jpg)

In this project, you will create a digital version of a painting inspired by the famous artist Damien Hirst. The goal is to use Python to generate a piece of art that mimics Hirst's style of colorful dots.

## Instructions

1. **Setup**: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You will also need the `turtle` module for drawing.

2. **Create the Canvas**: Use the `turtle` module to set up a drawing canvas.

3. **Draw the Dots**: Write a function to draw a series of colored dots on the canvas. You can use a list of colors to randomly choose the color for each dot.

4. **Arrange the Dots**: Arrange the dots in a grid pattern. You can use nested loops to position the dots correctly on the canvas.

5. **Customize**: Feel free to experiment with different colors, dot sizes, and grid patterns to create your unique piece of art.

6. **Save Your Work**: Save your final artwork as an image file.

By the end of this project, you will have a beautiful piece of digital art and a better understanding of how to use Python for creative projects.

## Tips

- Use the `turtle` module to draw shapes and patterns on the canvas.
- Get the color from a list of colors to create a colorful artwork.
- The colors can be gotten using the `colorgram` module.
- Use the cologram module to extract colors from an actual image of hirst painting.
- Use nested loops to arrange the dots in a grid pattern.
- Hide the turtle and set the speed to maximum for a cleaner drawing.
