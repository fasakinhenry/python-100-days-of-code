# Pong - The Famous Arcade Game

Pong was a game created by Allan Alcorn who was a fresh recruit of the Atari Company and was required to create a game in order to test his skills. The game happened to be pong and it became a huge success selling loads of machines across bars and pub around the world. You are meant to build the game on the day 21 of the Python 100 days

## Breaking down the Problem

In order to create the entire game, it is advisable to break down the problem into smaller parts of chunks that can be tackled easily. These are the parts I will be breaking down the problem to:

- Creating a Screen(The screen should be black. It should have a width of 800 and height of 600. It should also have a title and listen to key events from user)
- Creating and moving the player paddles(There should be a class to manage paddles meant to be used by Players. The paddles can move up and down during the game)
- Creating the Ball(The ball should be a white circle and should be able to move constantly on its own and bounce in contact with objects e.g wall, paddle)
- Detecting when Ball collides with Wall and ensuring the ball bounces
- Detecting when Ball collides with any player paddle and allow it to bounce in the opposite direction
- Detecting when paddle misses the ball
- Score keeping with the help of scoreboard(The both players should be able to screen their scores on the screen)
