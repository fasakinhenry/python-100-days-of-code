# Function with Outputs

Welcome to the day 10 of the 30 Days of Python series! In this section, we're going to learn about functions with outputs in Python.

In Python, functions can return data as a result. The data that a function returns is called the output of the function. To return data from a function, we use the `return` keyword followed by the data that we want to return. The `return` keyword is followed by an expression that is evaluated and returned to the caller. If the `return` statement is followed by multiple expressions, the function returns a tuple containing the expressions.
