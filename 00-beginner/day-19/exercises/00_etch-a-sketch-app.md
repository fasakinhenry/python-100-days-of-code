# Etch a sketch app

Create an Etch a Sketch app that allows you to draw on the screen by moving your cursor around the screen.

## Instructions

1. Create a turtle that starts at the center of the screen.
2. Create a screen that listens for the following keypresses:
   - "w": move the turtle forward
   - "s": move the turtle backward
   - "a": move the turtle counter-clockwise
   - "d": move the turtle clockwise
   - "c": clear the screen
   - "q": quit the app
3. When the turtle moves, it should draw a line on the screen.
4. When the screen is cleared, the turtle should go back to the center of the screen.
5. When the app is quit, the app should close.

## Project Hints

1. You can use the `turtle` module to create the turtle and the screen.
2. You can use the `onkey()` method to listen for keypresses.
3. You can use the `setheading()` method to change the direction of the turtle.
4. You can use the `clear()` method to clear the screen.
5. You can use the `exitonclick()` method to close the app when the user clicks on the screen.
6. You can use the `speed()` method to change the speed of the turtle.
7. You can use the `goto()` method to move the turtle to a specific position.
8. You can use the `up()` and `down()` methods to lift and lower the turtle's pen.
9. You can use the `onkeypress()` method to listen for keypresses.
10. You can use the `listen()` method to start listening for keypresses.
