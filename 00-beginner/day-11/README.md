# Day 11 - The Blackjack Capstone project

Welcome to Day 11 of the python 100 days of code. We would be creating a simple version of the blackjack game. We would be using a lot of the concepts we learnt from day 1 to 10. Some of which are:

- Functions
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Lists
- Dictionaries

The game will allow a user to play against the computer. The main features include:

- Drawing cards
- Calculating scores
- Determining the winner
- Option to play again

The best way to create complex projects like this is to break down the task into smaller bits or chunks that could be tackled easily. We can break this project into these following steps:

1. Implementing basic game logic
2. Handling user input
3. Simulating a deck of cards
4. Implementing game rules

## Steps to Complete the Project

1. Create a deck of cards
2. Deal initial cards to the player and the dealer
3. Allow the player to hit or stand
4. Implement the dealer's turn
5. Determine the winner
6. Ask the player if they want to play again

### Additional Challenges

These are potential features we may add to the project in the future ðŸš€

- Implement betting functionality
- Add a graphical user interface
- Allow multiple players

Happy coding!
