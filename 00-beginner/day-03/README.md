# Day 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators

Welcome to Day 3! Today, we will dive into control flow and logical operators in Python. Understanding these concepts is crucial as they allow you to control the execution of your code based on certain conditions. By the end of this day, you will be able to write more complex and dynamic programs.

## Concepts

### If Statements

If statements allow you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true. This is the simplest form of control flow.

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They include `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`.

### Logical Operators

Logical operators allow you to combine multiple conditions. The main logical operators are `and`, `or`, and `not`.

### Nested If Statements

You can place if statements inside other if statements to create more complex conditions.

### The `elif` Clause

The `elif` (else if) clause allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.

### The `else` Clause

The `else` clause allows you to execute a block of code if none of the previous conditions are true.
