# Inputs

Shows exercises about the input function in Python

## Instructions

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

e.g.

[Google Search: how to get the length of a string in python stack overflow](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow)

**Warning:** Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any name that you input.

## Example

**Input:**
```
Angela
```

**Output:**
```
6
```

## Hint

- You can put functions inside other functions.
- Don't try to print anything other than the length.
